# Student Feedback

## Most Helpful

- I really enjoyed how fast paced the classes were and how much information we were given to intake. I didn't find myself bored or waiting to continue.
- All of it, a lot of information that I feel will help me be a good developer.
- I like doing the lab work and being challenged. The TAs are very helpful.
- Getting to learn the terminal and git was something totally new, and I already feel relatively familiar with both platforms. I also really appreciated the stretch goals in the assignments. Having something extra to challenge myself with on the easier assignments was nice.
- The opportunity to work with fellow students and TA's in lab. I love the hands on learning and the ability to self-teach with guides available when I get stuck.
- The TA(s) have been extremely helpful. The recorded videos are helpful as well.
- Talking through code examples step by step is the most helpful.
- I really like code review and working with others. It has helped me think differently about code I'm having trouble with.

## Least Helpful

- I'm a little disappointed by how much of the first week just felt like review. If everyone had completed their Codecademy pre-work, all of this should have been old hat. Instead, people were getting stumped by basic ideas, like conditionals and loops. With the exception of the terminal and git, I feel like I could have skipped this week and not been a step behind.
- The HTML and CSS portions. Though they are important to learn much of it was covered in pre-work and is pretty simple to figure out just playing around. I would have preferred spending more time on understanding logic and functions.
- No aspects of the course stood out as 'least helpful' during this last week. If anything, I think the lack of time to really nail the concepts especially as a beginner programmer.
- The learning journals. Oddly enough, the reading. The pair project seemed ineffective.
- The speed I feel like I'm falling more and more behind, but i been told it normal to feel that way but it still over whelming.
- I don't think anything was particularly unhelpful. I might say applying real world solutions to code problems might help me wrap my head around what's going on.
- The examples used to present new ideas (example: functions, loops) are too obtuse. Using ‘thing’ ‘something else’ ‘this does something’ are not helpful. If you were to write a function the prints out Green if it runs correctly and Red if it runs incorrectly that would be easier to understand for a beginner.

## Questions, Suggestions, Concerns

- My concern is not about the TAs because they are trying to help. But many took the advantage of the TAs and hog most of their times. Sometimes some TAs spend most of their times with a few students and practically doing their homeworks, while others students could not get their attention and have their questions answer.
- This first week has been a little tough for me. I'm a bit anxious about next week. I hope we have enough TAs to get us all through our code problems.
- I am concerned on how quickly new fundamental ideas are introduced, breezed over with a poor example, and then compounded on top of. Also, the tangents can be distracting. It would be helpful to see a example from beginning-to-end when introducing a new concepts, functions, etc. Instead of going off and then trying to come back to finish the thought.
